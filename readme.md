# Best normalize

This is a combination of all the famous CSS normalize and CSS resets to make the best and most efficient CSS reset. This project is mostly intended to be used by one of our company's projects and it's very opinionated and incomplete, however, if there is enough demand I will make it into an actual package to be used by everyone.

All the necessary code is in the [best-normalize.css](/best-normalize.css) file.

Todo:
[] Add tests
[] Check missing decelerations

Sources used to make this project:

- [Normalize CSS](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
- [Modern normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
- [Sanitize CSS](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize)

Any contribution would be appreciated.
